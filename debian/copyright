 NOTE TO USERS *********************************
 .
 THIS IS A HEADER FILE, NOT A MANUAL
 .
 If you want to know how to use FFTW, please read the manual,
 online at http://www.fftw.org/doc/ and also included with FFTW.
 For a quick start, see the manual's tutorial section.
 .
 (Reading header files to learn how to use a library is a habit
 stemming from code lacking a proper manual.  Arguably, it's a
 *bad* habit in most cases, because header files can contain
 interfaces that are not part of the public, stable API.)

 Defines complex types that are bit compatible with C99's complex.h
 and (crucially) the same type as expected by fftw3.h.
 Note, don't use this with complex.h. fftw3.h checks to see whether
 complex.h is included and then uses that to set the interface.
 Since MSVC doesn't support C99, by using the following types we
 have a cross platform/compiler solution.
